### Submission procedure:

We have applied the machine learning algorithm to each of the 20 test cases in the testing data set. Then, for each test case we have submitted a text file with a single capital letter (A, B, C, D, or E) corresponding to our prediction for the corresponding problem in the test data set.

Creating these files required the enclosed "Submission.R" code. You can load the "pml_write_files" function by copying and pasting it into Rstudio. We have also created a "problem_results" folder in order to store the text files and set it as our working directory. Finally, we have run the "pml_write_files(answers)" command which produced the 20 requested files.
